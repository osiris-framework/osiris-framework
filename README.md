# Osiris-Framework

Osiris-Framework v1.337 is an open-source project designed to assist security researchers in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment exercises through unique features such as 0-days and helpers, custom-made modules, and the ability to provide valuable information about vulnerabilities in a specific target. Additionally, the framework can be executed in multi-platform systems which allows security researchers to perform audits from geographically widespread locations.
